  <h1>Shipping Method Page Type</h1>

  <p>The Shipping Method Page evaluates the Product's shipping attributes for the
  recipient's address against the Shipping Methods and Zones and the Requested Arrival
  Date to determine the available shipping methods and costs. These shipping methods are
  then displayed in ascending order based on cost.</p>

  <p>Here are the Page Type Properties available to this Page Type:</p>

  <table class="field">
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>&nbsp;</td>

        <td>&nbsp;</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>Product Description Type:</td>

        <td>Select whether you want the full description or short description to appear
          for Products in the customer's cart. The full description is generally a large, HTML description that may contain pictures.
          The short description is generally a smaller, plain-text description.</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>Submit Button Label:</td>

        <td>Enter the text you wish to display on the "Submit" button.</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>Next Page:</td>

        <td>Select the Billing Information Page that the Customer will be directed to
        when the Submit Button is clicked.</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

  <p><br />
  NOTE: If you don't ship any Products, you don't need to create a Page with this Page
  Type.</p>

  <p>
    If there are multiple Shipping Methods for the Customer to choose from, then the Customer will be required to click to select the Shipping Method that he/she wants (i.e. no Shipping Method will be selected by default).  However, if there is only one available Shipping Method, then that Shipping Method will be selected by default.  If there are no available Shipping Methods then an error message will be displayed on the Shipping Methods Page. So it's a good idea to at least create one Shipping Method that covers all your Shipping Zones if that is the appropriate solution for you.
