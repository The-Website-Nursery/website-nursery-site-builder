<h1>Shipping Report</h1><p></p>

<p>
    This screen allows you to view the number of Products that need to be shipped on different days.
    This is useful in order to determine how much inventory you need by a certain date.
</p>

<p>
    This screen displays data only for ship tos that contain a ship date and where there are unshipped items.  When an Order is submitted, the ship date is calculated based on the requested Arrival Date and stored in the ship to.  The ship date is the date that the system recommends you ship items in order for those items to be delivered by the requested Arrival Date.  You can read more about how the ship date is calculated in the help for the view order screen.
</p>

<p>
    You can update the shipped quantity on the view order screen in order to tell the system that all items have been shipped.  Once you do that, then those items will no longer appear on the shipping report.  You can also remove the ship date from the ship to on the view order screen, if you don't want items for that ship to to appear in the shipping report.
</p>

<p>
    You can use the arrows next to the date range to change the range of dates in the view.  The before column shows all data before the current date range.  This is useful to see data for older Orders that have still not been shipped, for whatever reason, so they are not forgotten.  The after column shows all data after the current date range, so you can prepare inventory.  You can click a column heading in order to see a list of Orders for that column.  You will be taken to the All Orders screen and the advanced filters will be set automatically for you so that the correct results appear.  Alternatively, you can click on a Product description in order to quickly edit a Product.
