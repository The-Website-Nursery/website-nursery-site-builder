  <h1>All Designer Regions</h1>

  <p>Designer Regions are shared content areas that you can create for only your Site
  Designers to maintain directly from a Page. &nbsp;These areas are better for widget
  coding, javascript, etc., where you don't want someone without HTML programming
  knowledge to accidentally edit it.</p>

  <p>Designer&nbsp;Regions typically contain javascript, HTML widgets, embedded Flash
  objects, etc.</p>

  <p>Since Designer Regions are placed into Page Styles, they become shared content that
  can be displayed on one, some, or all of your website Pages.</p>

  <p>TIP: Designer Regions are ideal for adding news feeds and other third-party widgets
  to your website.</p>

  <p>Unlike Page Regions, Designer Regions must be create manually by the Site Designer
  before they can be edited.</p>

  <p>NOTE: Designer Regions are not editable using the&nbsp;Rich-text Editor because
  it&nbsp;strips out non-HTML/CSS tags in an attempt to "clean" the content before it is
  saved. It does this to help the Content Managers from adding bad tags to their Page
  content and breaking the Page's layout and functionality.</p>

  <h2>Searching Designer Regions</h2>

  <p>You can enter a search term in the box on this screen and search for any Designer
  Region by it's properties and content.</p>

  <h2>Site Search Widget</h2>

  <p>Site Search Widget is a PHP script that you can embed in any Designer Region or Page
  Style that will allow your Visitors to search Pages for content and return the results
  on the Search Results Page. &nbsp;You can place the Site Search Widget anywhere on your
  site.</p>

  <p>All "searchable" Pages will be searched by the Site Search Widget. &nbsp;If you
  don't want some Pages found, even if the Visitor or User has access to it's
  Folder,&nbsp;disable "Include in Search" in those Pages and they will not be found.</p>

  <p>Site Search will only display the search results for Pages that the Visitor or User
  has "view" access to. &nbsp;So,&nbsp;website Visitor will only see search results from
  Pages that are in Public Folders, and Members will see both results from Public Folder
  Pages and Membership Folder Pages, and so on.</p>

  <p>To add the Site Search Widget to your website, simply cut and paste the HTML below
  into any Designer Region or directly into a Page Style, be sure to replace the
  "/login/" directory with the directory you login with:</p>

  <p><span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">&lt;form
  action="/login/search.php" style="margin: 0px"&gt;</span><br style=
  "font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;" />
  <span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">&lt;input type="text"
  name="query" class="search-query" /&gt;&lt;input type="submit" value="Search"
  class="search-submit" /&gt;</span><br style=
  "font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;" />
  <span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">&lt;/form&gt;</span></p>

  <p>TIP:&nbsp; You may also point the form action to a Search Results Page. (ex.
  action="/pages/search_results")</p>

  <p>NOTE:&nbsp; Site Search Widget only searches Page Regions and not Common Regions or
  Menus. &nbsp;This is necessary of else the search results would return duplicate
  information for all Page that share content from Common Regions.</p>

  <p>IMPORTANT: Be sure that all Pages that should be searched have "Include in Search"
  Page Property selected, and that you have a Search Results Page created that is in a
  Public Folder.</p>

  <h2>Embedded Media</h2>

  <p>Adding media objects to your Designer Region is easy. &nbsp;However, we have found
  some issues with their use on some client computers. &nbsp;If you are having problems
  rendering your embedded media that has been uploaded to your website, edit the media's
  Properties and&nbsp;use the actual URL</p>

  <p>(e.g. <span style=
  "font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">/[dir]/get_file.php?name=example.wmv</span>)
  instead of the virtual URL (e.g. <span style=
  "font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">/files/example.wmv</span>). We are not
  sure why the rewriting</p>

  <p>of the URLs matters, but it appears that a small percentage of client computers
  don't like the virtual URLs, probably because of some unrelated compatibility issue
  that has not been indentified.</p>

  <p>If that does not work, you should also consider adding a URL parameter to your
  media's Properties as follows, since there seems&nbsp;to be an issue for some versions
  of the&nbsp;Internet Explorer browser:</p>

  <p><span style=
  "font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">&lt;object&gt;...</span><span style=
  "font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">&lt;param name="url"
  value="/files/example.wmv" /&gt;...</span><span style=
  "font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">&lt;/object&gt;</span></p>

  <p>Be sure to also replace the virtual URL with the actual URL as described above.</p>
