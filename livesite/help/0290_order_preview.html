  <h1>Order Preview Page Type</h1>

  <p>This Page Type is provided so that you can create your own custom Order Preview Page
  for your checkout process. This page displays all the subtotals and totals for the
  Order including optional taxes and shipping costs. Payment information is requested and
  stored in the User's Account and Contact. The page also requires the Visitor to check
  the box to agree to your terms and to complete the Order.</p>

  <p>NOTE: If you are collecting credit/debit card information on this Page, then it is
  required for PCI compliance that your site have an SSL certificate and that secure mode
  be enabled. Please contact your hosting provider for more information about an SSL
  certificate, and please see the Site Settings for more information about secure
  mode.</p>

  <p>Here are the Page Type Properties available to this Page Type:</p>

  <table class="field">
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>&nbsp;</td>

        <td>&nbsp;</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>Product Description Type:</td>

        <td>Select whether you want the full description or short description to appear
          for Products in the customer's cart. The full description is generally a large, HTML description that may contain pictures.
          The short description is generally a smaller, plain-text description.</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>Card Verification Number Page:</td>

        <td>Enter the Page that you wish to have pop-up in a new window when the "what's
        this?" link is clicked next to the Credit Card verification Number field in the
        Payment Information area. This optional feature will help some people that don't
        know where the find the Card Verification Number on their payment card.</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
          <td>Always Allow Offline Payments:</td>

          <td>

            <p>
              Check this field if you want every Customer to be able to select offline payment as a payment method when they submit an Order on this Page, even if "Only on specific orders" is enabled in the site settings.  In other words, this property allows you to override the "Only on specific orders" site setting for a particular Page.
            </p>

            <p>
              Often, you will want to enable the "Only on specific orders" site setting so that the offline payment option is only available for approved Orders.  However, sometimes you might need staff members to submit offline payment Orders on behalf of customers.  If so, you can create a hidden or private Order pathway and use this setting to allow those staff members to choose the offline payment option, when necessary.  This will allow those staff members to select offline payment, even if they don't have a User account or their User account is not set to allow them to select offline payment for Orders.
            </p>

            <p>
              This property is available for both Order Preview and Express Order Pages.  You will need to allow offline payments in the site settings for this property to appear.  Please be aware that unchecking this field will not necessarily disable offline payments.  Please see the site settings if you need to disable offline payments.
            </p>

      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>Offline Payment Label:</td>

        <td>When "Allow Offline Payments" is enabled in the Site Settings this field will
        be used as the offline payment option name when outputting the available payment
        methods.</td>

      <tr>
        <td>Terms Page:</td>

        link is clicked next to the Acceptance of Terms check box.<br />
        This approval step is required for so that payment cards can be legally charged,
        even if services or shipments are delayed (since the terms can specify it). You
        might include your cancellation, refund, and/or return policies in this pop up
        Standard Page.</td>

      <tr>
        <td>Submit Button Label:</td>

        <td>Enter the text you wish to display on the "Purchase Now" Button. When this
        button is pressed, the payment gateway (if enabled) will be contacted securely
        and the transaction will be processed.</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>Pre-Save Hook Code:</td>
        <td>
          You can use this field to enter PHP code that you want to execute when an Order is submitted.  This is useful if you have custom processes that need to happen once an Order is submitted.  The code is executed after the system's field validation, but before the transaction is initiated with the payment gateway (if one is enabled) and before the Order is considered to be completed.

          <p>In order to use this feature this site must have an Elite hosting plan or software subscription and your User role must be Administrator or Designer.  Also, your site administrator must enable PHP regions by adding the following to the config.php file.  If you can see this field, then PHP regions are already enabled.</p>

          <p><em>define('PHP_REGIONS', true);</em></p>

          <p>You may enter the opening &lt;?php and closing ?&gt; tags in this field, however they are not required.</p>

          <p>

        <td>
          This field offers the same feature as the pre-save hook code field above, however this code is only run after a successful transaction with the payment gateway (if one is configured) and after the Order is considered to be completed.

        from ordered Products will be BCC'd on the e-mail. The from name will be the
