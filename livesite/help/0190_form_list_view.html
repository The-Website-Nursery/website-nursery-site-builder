  <h1>Form List View Page Type</h1>

  <p>Form List View Page Type displays one or more rows of submitted data collected from
  a Custom Form. &nbsp;<br />
  <br />
  Here are the Page Type Properties available to this Page Type:</p>

  <table class="field" border="0">
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>&nbsp;</td>

        <td>&nbsp;</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>
          <p>Custom Form:</p>
        </td>

        <td>
          <p>Select the existing Custom Form from which you want to display it's
          submitted form data.</p>
        </td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>
          <p>Form Item View:</p>
        </td>

        <td>
          <p>Select the Form Item View that this Form List View will link to. This is
          used by various features (e.g. ^^form_item_view^^, Form View Directory,
          advanced site search, RSS) in order to determine which Form Item View is
          connected to this Form List View. It is important that you select this field
          properly so that links to the Form Item View work correctly.</p>
        </td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td>
          <p>Header:</p>
        </td>

        <td>
          <p>This is an optional field that allows you to enter HTML that will appear before the list of Submitted Forms.  This field can be used in combination with the footer below to wrap HTML around the list of Submitted Forms.  For example, you could enter &lt;div class="example_wrapper"&gt; for the header and &lt;/div&gt; for the footer.</p>

          <p>The content for this field is outputted directly above the list of Submitted Forms.  For example, the content will appear below the search field that might exist.  Also, the content for this field is only outputted if at least one Submitted Form appears.  If there are no results, then the content is not outputted.</p>
        </td>
      </tr>
