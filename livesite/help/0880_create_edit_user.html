  <h2>Login as User</h2>

  <p>
    When editing a User, you can click the "Login as User" button in the button bar in order to easily login as the User without having to enter the User's login info.  You might want to do this in order to test the site as a less-privileged User in order to make sure everything is setup properly.  Also, this can be useful if you want to perform an action for a User (e.g. submit an Order) and have everything be saved to that User's account instead of your own.  
  </p>

  <p>
    Once you click the "Login as User" button, you will be forwarded to the start screen for that User, just as if the User had logged in.  You will then experience the site exactly as that User would.  This means that the control panel toolbar might not appear, depending on the User's access level, or etc.  Once you are done with that User's account, you may logout.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you selected to be remembered when you originally logged in with your own account, the system will automatically log you back in to your own account.  However, if you did not select to be remembered, then you will need to login to your own account again.  Either way, simply click the login link that appears on the logout screen.
  </p>

  <p>
    Please be aware of the following:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>As long as a User is allowed to edit a specific User, then the User can also login as that specific User.</li>
    <li>The "Login as User" button will not appear for the User that you are currently logged in with.</li>
    <li>The Site Log keeps track of which Users are logging in as different Users.</li>
    <li>When you complete actions under the different User account, log messages, last modified stats, and etc. will contain the username for the different User (not your own account).</li>
    <li>Your session will be reset when you login as a different User.  This means that the system will forget various settings from that browser session (e.g. search keyword and sort column on various view screens).</li>
    <li>If you have a tracking code or affiliate code cookie, then they will be removed when you login as a different User.  Also, they will not be added back once you logout of that User's account.</li>
    <li>If a User's account currently has a temporary password (e.g. the account was recently created), you will not be required to change the temporary password when you login as that User.  However, the User will still be required to change the password when he/she logs in as him/herself.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><br />
  WARNING: If you create a User with the same e-mail address as an existing Contact, no
  connection between the two will be made by the system. If you do this by mistake, you
  can delete the Contact and ask the User to register again, so that a new Contact can be
  created by the System and connected to the User. You can reference the "My Contacts by
  User" and "My Registered User" screens to display all connected Contacts and User
  accounts.</p>
